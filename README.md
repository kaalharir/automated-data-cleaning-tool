Project: Automated Data Cleaning Tool for Healthcare Datasets
Background:
During my internship at a healthcare research institute, I observed that data cleaning was a time-consuming and error-prone process. Researchers spent significant effort manually identifying and correcting inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers in large healthcare datasets. To address this challenge, I decided to create an automated data cleaning tool.

My Contributions:
Design and Implementation:
I designed a Python tool that takes raw healthcare data (CSV files) as input and performs the following tasks:
Imputes missing values using mean or mode.
Detects and removes outliers based on z-scores.
Standardizes numerical features.
Cleans text data (removing special characters, converting to lowercase).
The tool is modular, allowing users to customize cleaning steps based on their specific dataset requirements.
Integration with Existing Workflows:
I seamlessly integrated the tool into the instituteâ€™s data preprocessing pipeline. Researchers could now run the tool as a pre-processing step before analysis.
The tool significantly reduced manual effort, improved data quality, and ensured consistency across studies.
Impact:
Researchers benefited in two ways:
Time Savings: Hours of manual data cleaning were saved, allowing them to focus on analysis and insights.
Data Quality: The tool improved data quality, leading to more reliable research outcomes.
